# Customiizer Theme

This WordPress theme powers the Customiizer site. Some features rely on PHP's GD extension for generating PNG images.

## PNG compression

Only mockup images converted from WebP to PNG use the `PNG_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` constant defined in `utilities.php`. This constant is read by the `convert_webp_to_png_server()` function in `includes/generate_mockup.php`. The value ranges from `0` (no compression) to `9` (maximum compression). Higher compression reduces file size but increases CPU usage when saving images.

Adjust `PNG_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` if you need smaller mockup files or faster image generation.

The default value is set to `8` for near-maximum compression.

`MOCKUP_MAX_DIMENSION` controls the maximum width or height of PNG mockup images.  
Images larger than this value are downscaled before saving. The default is `1500` pixels.

## Position editor

Enable the checkbox "Activer l'éditeur de position" in the **Custom Produits** admin page to adjust the mockup position on product pages. When enabled, `js/product/position_editor.js` is enqueued automatically.

The editor shows two range sliders controlling the top and left position (in pixels). Values range from -200 to 200 and move one pixel at a time. Each slider displays its current value next to it. After tweaking the values, press **Save** to send them to `/variant/<id>/mockup-position` with the selected `mockup_id`.
